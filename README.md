# AWS_SSO_Terraform_Environment_Export

This was for only a few specific versions of Terraform when used from a Windows computer (hence the powershell). No one should have this issue anymore.

This script was to help you get logged into aws via aws sso, refresh your token, and export your environment variables if you're experiencing auth issues when using terraform with the new (at the time) SSO login setup for AWS.
